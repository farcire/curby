# Curby Backend - Parking Regulation System

**Last Updated:** December 4, 2025
**Status:** ✅ Beta Ready (⚠️ Known Data Quality Issues)

## Overview

Backend system for managing San Francisco parking regulations, street sweeping schedules, and meter data using CNN-based street segments. Provides REST API for real-time parking eligibility queries with <100ms response time.

## Recent Investigation & Architecture Change

### Summary of Investigation (Nov 2024)

**Problem Identified**: Parking regulations were not being joined to blockfaces during data ingestion.

**Root Causes Found**:
1. Parking regulations lack CNN fields → Required spatial join instead of direct CNN matching
2. Function call bug in side determination (line 324)
3. Incorrect field mapping for regulation data
4. **Critical**: Only 7.4% of streets have blockface geometries from pep9-66vw dataset

**Fixes Implemented**:
- ✅ Spatial join for parking regulations using geometric distance matching
- ✅ Fixed `get_side_of_street()` function call
- ✅ Corrected field mappings (hrlimit, rpparea1, regulation, etc.)
- ✅ Result: 136 parking regulations successfully attached

**Architecture Decision**: 
Migrating from blockface-based to **CNN-based street segment architecture** to achieve 100% coverage.

## Current Status

- ✅ **Technical Fixes**: Complete
- ✅ **Architecture Planning**: Complete
- ✅ **CNN Segment Implementation**: Complete (34,292 segments)
- ✅ **Database**: Fully populated with Mission District data
- ✅ **API**: Production-ready with geospatial queries
- ✅ **Frontend Integration**: Complete
- ✅ **Performance**: <100ms for 95% of queries
- 🔄 **AI Integration**: In progress (Gemini 2.0 Flash for regulation interpretation)
- ⚠️ **Data Quality**: Known issues documented (see [DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md](DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md))

## Data Sources

- **Active Streets** (3psu-pn9h): Street centerlines with CNN identifiers **+ Address Ranges** (lf_fadd, lf_toadd, rt_fadd, rt_toadd)
  - ✅ **Address ranges now stored in StreetSegment model** (fromAddress, toAddress fields)
  - Enables direct address-based queries and conflict resolution
- **Parking Regulations** (hi6h-neyh): Regulations with geometry and RPP codes (`rpparea1` field) - **PRIMARY source for RPP zones**
- **Street Cleaning** (yhqp-riqs): Sweeping schedules by CNN + side + cardinal directions (via `blockside` field)
  - ✅ **Fixed**: Cardinal directions now correctly ingested and displayed (Nov 2024)
  - ⚠️ **Known Issue**: Some street cleaning records missing from dataset (see [DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md](DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md#issue-1-missing-street-cleaning-records))
- **Parcel Overlay** (9grn-xjpx): Administrative boundaries for conflict resolution (boundary cases only)
- **Blockface Geometries** (pep9-66vw): Side-specific geometries (7.4% coverage)
- **Meters** (8vzz-qzz9, 6cqg-dxku): Parking meter locations and schedules

## Architecture

### Current (Blockface-Based)
```
Blockface {
    cnn: String
    side: "L" | "R"
    geometry: LineString  // Only 7.4% have this
    rules: [...]
}
```

**Problem**: Only 148 of 2,007 CNNs have blockface geometries

### New (CNN-Based Street Segments)
```
StreetSegment {
    cnn: String           // Primary identifier
    side: "L" | "R"       // Which side of street
    streetName: String
    fromStreet: String    // Block boundaries
    toStreet: String
    fromAddress: String   // Starting address (e.g., "3401")
    toAddress: String     // Ending address (e.g., "3449")
    centerlineGeometry: LineString  // Always available
    blockfaceGeometry: LineString | null  // Optional
    rules: [...]
}
```

**Benefits**:
- 100% coverage (4,014 segments = 2,007 CNNs × 2 sides)
- Address ranges stored for each side
- Enables address-based RPP matching and queries

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB URI and SFMTA API token

# Run ingestion
bash run_ingestion.sh
```

## Quick Start - Run Migration

### Execute CNN Segment Migration
```bash
cd backend
./run_cnn_segment_migration.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
python3 ingest_data_cnn_segments.py  # Step 1: Ingest
python3 validate_cnn_segments.py     # Step 2: Validate
```

### Expected Results
- ✅ 34,324 street segments created (2 per CNN for 17,162 Active Streets)
- ✅ 100% coverage achieved (All Active Streets)
- ✅ 22,573 segments with street cleaning data (65.8% of segments)
  - **Note**: This reflects 100% of the data provided in the cleaning dataset.
  - The missing ~34% corresponds to streets not present in the official `yhqp-riqs` source (likely private/non-swept streets).
- ✅ 6,965 segments with parking regulations
- ✅ 4,090 segments with parking meters

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/blockfaces/{id}` - Get specific blockface

### New (CNN Segments - To Be Implemented)

- `GET /api/segments/{cnn}/{side}` - Get specific segment

## Testing & Validation

### CNN Segment Ingestion Flow
1. **Load Active Streets** → Create 2 segments per CNN (L & R) + **Store address ranges** (fromAddress, toAddress)
2. **Add Blockface Geometries** → Optional enhancement where available
3. **Match Street Sweeping** → Direct CNN + side match + capture cardinal directions
4. **Match Parking Regulations** → Spatial join with distance analysis (<10m = clear, 10-50m = boundary)
   - Extract RPP zones from regulation's `rpparea1` field
   - Assign to CNN L and/or CNN R based on distance
   - Use Parcel Overlay for boundary conflict resolution
5. **Match Meters** → CNN + location inference
6. **Save to MongoDB** → With proper indexes

**Address Range Storage (Implemented Nov 2024):**
- Left segments: `fromAddress` = `lf_fadd`, `toAddress` = `lf_toadd`
- Right segments: `fromAddress` = `rt_fadd`, `toAddress` = `rt_toadd`
- Example: CNN 799000 Left side stores "3401" to "3449"

### Key Features
- **Spatial join for regulations**: Distance-based CNN L/R assignment with boundary resolution
- **RPP from regulations**: RPP zones come directly from regulation records (`rpparea1`)
- **Address ranges for queries**: Enable address-based lookups and conflict resolution
- **Direct street cleaning join**: 100% coverage via CNN + Side fields
- **Cardinal directions**: User-friendly display (N, S, E, W, etc.)
- **100% coverage**: Every CNN gets L & R segments
- **Dual geometries**: Centerline (required) + blockface (optional)

## Data Quality

### Known Issues

The system has identified data quality issues in the source SFMTA datasets. See [`DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md`](DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md) for complete details.

**Critical Issue**: Some street cleaning schedules are missing from the Socrata dataset despite existing physically. Example:
- **CNN 961000R** (19th St, North side): Missing Thursday 12AM-6AM cleaning schedule
- Impact: Users won't see this restriction, risking parking tickets
- Status: Documented and reported to SFMTA

### Data Quality Tools

**Investigation Scripts**:
- [`inspect_cnn_961000.py`](inspect_cnn_961000.py) - Investigate specific CNN data
- Investigation reports in [`cnn_961000_investigation/`](cnn_961000_investigation/)

**Validation Scripts** (Planned):
- Missing street cleaning detector
- Cardinal direction validator
- Data completeness checker

### Workarounds Implemented

**None yet** - Planned workarounds:
1. Cardinal direction inference from geometry
2. Street limit fallback to Active Streets data
3. Display name generation without street cleaning data
4. User warnings for incomplete data

See [`DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md`](DATA_QUALITY_ISSUES.md) for detailed action plans.
